# RFM_analysis-Python
RFM analysis of customers of a globally operating company. 
Full ETL process with database cleaning, clustering through sklearn Kmeans and visualisation with Matplotlib.pyplot, Plotly Express and Seaborn.  
This model is normally used to identify purchasing paternals, group customers with similar behaviour and better allocate resources to retain the most profitable customers.
A 3D scatterplot is used as a silhouette curve.
The business value of this analysis is, for example, in a marketing campaign to promote using 4 of the 5 clusters obtained as an audience, in fact removing the churn rate cluster.
